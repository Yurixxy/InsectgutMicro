PRJNA1022150,Bumble bee,Hymenoptera,Exposure to a fungicide for a field-realistic duration does not alter bumble bee fecal microbiotas,"Social bees are frequently exposed to pesticides when foraging on nectar and pollen. Recent research has shown that pesticide exposure not only impacts social bee host health but can also alter the community structure of social bee gut microbiotas. However, most research on pesticide-bee gut microbiota interactions has been conducted in honey bees; bumble bees, native North American pollinators, have received less attention and, due to differences in their ecology, may be exposed to certain pesticides for shorter durations than honey bees. Here we examined how exposure to the fungicide chlorothalonil for a short, field-realistic duration altered bumble bee fecal microbiotas (used as a proxy for gut microbiotas) and host performance. We exposed Bombus impatiens microcolonies to field-realistic chlorothalonil concentrations for five days, tracking changes in fecal microbiotas during the exposure period and a nine-day recovery period, and comparing microcolony production between treatments at the end of the experiment. We also assessed the use of fecal microbiotas as a gut microbiota proxy by comparing community structures of fecal and gut microbiotas. We found that chlorothalonil exposure did not alter bumble bee fecal microbiota structure or affect microcolony production at any concentration, but that fecal and gut microbiotas differed significantly in community structure. Our results highlight the importance of considering ecologically relevant exposure periods when investigating the effects of toxicants on animal microbiotas and host health, and the importance of sampling gut microbiotas directly, when possible.",single,0,0

PRJNA1004019,Scyphophorus acupunctatus Gyllenhal,Coleoptera,"Disentangling the gut microbiota of the agave weevil, Scyphophorus acupunctatus Gyllenhal, 1838 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)","The agave weevil, Scyphophorus acupunctatus, is a pest species of agave whose larvae cause damage to agaves by boring holes in the plant. The borer activity requires that the insect consume the constituents of its host plant, which is full of sugar and many recalcitrant polymers. Since many years ago, it has been hypothesized that the gut microbiota of S. acupunctatus larvae plays a role in the metabolization of agave components, but no studies to explore the structure of the gut microbiota of this insect have been performed so far. In this work, we used a 16S rRNA gene-based metabarcoding approach to determine the dynamics of the gut microbiota of field-collected agave weevils from different localities in Mexico. We found that external factors, including host plants, greatly influence the gut bacterial communities of this species. Despite this, we found a discrete core microbiota mainly composed of the genera Prevotella, Pectinatus, Liquorilactobacillus, Secundibacillus, Paucilactobacillus, and Pseudomonas. Our research shows that environmental conditions have a significant effect on the gut microbiota of S. acupunctatus. However, the tight relationship between Prevotella and other genera in the core microbiota could be necessary for the host as metabolic helpers and/or gatekeepers. Additional studies are needed to fully assess the functionality of the gut microbiota in terms of its metabolic contribution, which may help to infer their potential ecological implications, but the information we provided here is the first step to guiding further questions.",paired,1,1

Given its ability to adapt to various host plants, it is crucial to examine the influence of nutritional composition on the life-history flexibility of B. dorsalis. This study aimed to examine the impact of different sucrose levels on the life-history traits of B. dorsalis and plasticity of their gut microbiota, shedding light on host adaptation. The results indicated that a low-sucrose diet (3%) led to a significant increase in the body size of B. dorsalis, whereas a high-sucrose diet (22%) resulted in a notable decrease in body size. Moreover, a low-sucrose diet led to a larger ovaries and longer lifespans of adult flies compared to those in the control group. Additionally, the consumption of a high-sucrose diet caused substantial alterations in the intestinal microbiota of B. dorsalis when compared to the control group. Notably, 26 and 17 species of gut microbe were found to be enriched in the low-sucrose and high-sucrose diets, respectively. These findings suggest that specific intestinal microbes might contribute to enhancing the adaptability of B. dorsalis. By elucidating the effects of sucrose concentration on the life history, this study deepens our understanding of the adaptive mechanisms underlying insect-microbiome holobiont. It provides a foundation for further exploration into the adaptive mechanisms of B. dorsalis and its microbiome, emphasizing the significance of sucrose concentration in shaping insect life history.",paired,0,0

PRJEB61400,Coleoptera,Coleoptera,The gut microbiome mediates adaptation to scarce food in cave Coleoptera,"Beetles are ubiquitous cave invertebrates worldwide and cave colonization involves a drastic transition from abundant nutrient sources on the surface to the subterranean scarce resources. We investigated the potential role of gut microbiota in cave adaptation of beetles in Carpathian caves from different climatic regions of Romania. The sediment microbiota was relatively constant in taxonomic structure across all seasons and was similar between all five caves. Uncultured phyla Patescibacteria and GAL15 were highly represented. In comparison, the beetles’ microbiota was host specific, reflecting both phylogenetic and nutritional adaptation. The microbial community structure further resolved conspecific beetles by caves suggesting microbiota-host coevolution and influences by local environmental factors. The detritivore Leiodidae hosted a variety of bacterial taxa known to decompose and ferment organic matter including in other animal guts, suggesting turnover and host cooperative digestion of the sedimentary microbiota and allochthonous derived nutrients. The Carabidae represented by Duvalius, beetles with strong mandibulae adapted to predation and scavenging of animal and plant remains, had distinct microbiota dominated by symbiotic lineages of Spiroplasma or Wolbachia.

Given that much of physiology is under circadian regulation, we used a Drosophila model to ask how the microbiome interacts with circadian rhythms in the gut. We found that the microbiome itself did not cycle in flies fed ad libitum. A timed feeding (TF) paradigm induced oscillations of some species in clockless per01 flies but effects were small and this paradigm did not detectably enhance fitness. Despite limited circadian, TF and the presence of a microbiome influenced the composition of the gut circadian transcriptome, independently and in concert. In addition, TF altered the phase and amplitude of rhythmic gene expression, with the latter mediated, at least in part, by widespread changes in histone acetylation. Loss of the microbiome increased cycling amplitude in germ-free animals. However, despite their higher amplitude circadian cycling, germ-free flies reset more rapidly following a circadian disruption paradigm. We propose that the microbiome stabilizes cycling in the host gut to prevent rapid fluctuations under different environmental conditions.",paired,1,1

The herbicide Glyphosate and the insecticide Imidacloprid are among the most used pesticides worldwide, although different studies evidenced their detrimental effects on non-target organisms. The emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and the recent ban of imidacloprid in Europe due to safety concerns, has prompted their replacement by new molecules, such as glufosinate-ammonium (GA) and sulfoxaflor (S). GA is a broad-spectrum and non-selective herbicide that inhibits a key enzyme in the metabolism of nitrogen, causing accumulation of lethal levels of ammonia; while sulfoxaflor is an agonist at insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and generates excitatory responses including tremors, paralysis and mortality. Although those molecules are being increasingly used for crop protection, little is known about their effects on non-target organisms. In this study we assessed the impact of chronic and acute exposure to sublethal doses of GA and S on honey bee gut microbiota, immunity and survival. We found GA significantly reduced the number of gut bacteria, and decreased the expression of glucose oxidase, a marker of social immunity. On the other hand, S significantly increased the number of gut bacteria altering the microbiota composition, decreased the expression of lysozyme and increased the expression of hymenoptaecin. These alterations in gut microbiota and immunocompetence may lead to an increased susceptibility to pathogens. Finally, both pesticides shortened honey bee survival and increased the risk of death. Those results evidence the negative impact of GA and S on honey bees, even at single exposition to a low dose, and provide useful information to the understanding of pollinators decline.",paired,0,0

Polystyrene, including extruded polystyrene also known as styrofoam, is among the most commonly produced plastics worldwide and is recalcitrant to microbial degradation. In this study, we examined superworms (Zophobas morio) reared on bran, polystyrene, and under starvation conditions and assessed changes in the insects gut microbiome. Superworms on a polystyrene diet achieved only minimal weight gains, but were able to complete their life cycle to pupae and imago. Microbial gut communities differed considerably between diet groups, with polystyrene and starvation groups characterized by a loss of microbial diversity combined with the presence of opportunistic pathogens. Inferred microbial functions enriched in the polystyrene group included transposon movements, membrane restructuring, and adaptations to oxidative stress. We detected several encoded enzymes with reported polystyrene and styrene degradation abilities and provided first insights into involved metabolic pathways, supporting previous reports of polystyrene degrading bacteria in the superworm gut. However, we cannot rule out that the microbiome also metabolized other chemicals, such as flame retardants, present in low concentrations in styrofoam. By recovering metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) we linked phylogeny and functions and identified genera, including Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Corynebacterium, that possess genes associated with polystyrene degradation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the survival of superworms on polystyrene feed, however, this diet has considerable negative impacts on gut microbiome diversity and host health.",paired,0,0

Whereas the role of the endosymbiont has been fully elucidated, the function of the gut microbiota remains unclear. Its study will benefit from the availability of insects deprived of Blattabacterium. Our goal is to determine the effect of the removal (or, at least, reduction) of the endosymbiont population on the cockroach’s fitness under a normal gut microbiota community. For this purpose, we treated our cockroach population with rifampicin to decrease the amount of endosymbiont in the following generation. As the treatment also affects rifampicin-sensitive gut bacteria, we allowed it to recover for at least 20 days before sampling. We found that after this antibiotic treatment, the endosymbiont population remained extremely reduced and only the microbiota was able to recover, although it could not compensate for the endosymbiont role, and host’s fitness was drastically affected. This accomplished reduction, however, is not homogenous and requires further study to develop stable quasi-aposymbiotic cockroaches.",paired,0,0

We found that the microbiota increased the rate of interaction between bees and the complexity of the emergent colony social network. Microbiota colonization was associated with higher abundances of one third of the metabolites detected in the brain, including amino acids with roles in synaptic transmission and brain energetic function. A subset of these metabolites were significant predictors of the number of social interactions of bees.

A healthy gut microbiome is tied to central metabolism, provides protection from pathogens, aids in detoxification, and primes the immune system. Among the worker caste, age-based polytheism dictates the division of labor and is also integral to colony success. Independent of age, the honey bee worker can assume various physiological/behavioral roles based on colony needs. We investigated the disruption of worker age demographics on the ileum and rectum (hindgut) microbiomes, specifically, we forced foragers to revert to nursing; a task associated with youthful physiology. We hypothesized that the repeated consumption of pollen would result in oxidative stress and alterations to the microbiota. We found that the core hindgut microbiome remained relatively stable, with the exception of two putative opportunistic bacteria that differed by treatment. Associated with increased expression of prophenoloxidase (PPO) in reverted foragers, we observed the formation of diverticula in the midgut suggesting a loss of gut integrity. Collectively, our results suggest stability of the hindgut microbiome, but senescence of the midgut with reversion phenotypes becoming susceptible to septicemia.",paired,1,1

Gut bacteria may even reduce or block the transmission of arboviruses in several species of arthropod vectors. Culicoides biting midges are important arboviral vectors of several livestock and wildlife diseases, yet limited information is available on their gut bacterial communities. Addressing this gap will help inform how these communities can be manipulated and ultimately used as novel tools to control pathogens. To assess how bacterial communities change during the life stages of lab-reared C. nubeculosus and C. sonorensis , endosymbiotic bacteria were identified using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA and taxonomically characterized. Analyses were conducted to determine how gut bacterial communities in adults are influenced by species identity and geographic distance among biting midge populations. Communities of the two lab-reared Culicoides species significantly changed after pupation and with maturation into six-day-old adults. Pseudomonas, Burkholderiaceae and Leucobacter bacteria were part of a core community that was trans-stadially transmitted and found throughout their life cycle. Among field-collected biting midges, the bacterial communities were unique for almost each species. Cardinium, Rickettsia and Wolbachia were some of the most abundant bacteria in midges collected from wetlands. Only Pseudomonas was present in high relative abundance in all field-collected species.

Aging, climate and social gene expression are all expected to play a major role in disease susceptibility throughout the winter months. Here we used a marked cohort of known-age worker honey bees to investigate the integrity of mouthpart and midgut microbiomes of overwintering workers at 19, 33, 50, and 70 days of age. We quantified gene expression associated with oxidative stress and social immunity from a mouthpart associated secretory (hypopharygeal) gland that interfaces with the extended social environment on many levels. Our results provide the first evidence that social immune expression is associated with the core gut microbiota in honey bees, and highlights the midgut as a vulnerable tissue overwinter in warm southern climates. Results suggest many microbiota centric hypotheses including cooperation, competition, and social hygienic host response to hive opportunists. We discovered a distinct physiological and microbiological trajectory of southern diutinus (long-lived) workers that differs drastically from the younger, short-lived workers in the colony. Antioxidant gene expression in aging bees was associated with decreased fungal load on the mouth, increases in core microbiota and increased longevity. The cold indoor overwintering environment was associated with a small and stable midgut microbiota structure and stable gene expression overwinter. In contrast, warm outdoor overwintering was associated with changes co-occurring throughout the alimentary tract microbiota that suggest both disease presence and resistance in older workers, but increased disease susceptibility for younger workers that emerged during the winter, including increases in Enterobacteriaceae, fungal load and other bacterial opportunists.

Different studies have shown the great impact that sublethal doses of this pesticide have on the health of non-target insects such as honey bees. In this study we investigated the sublethal effects of chronic exposure of imidacloprid on the immune response of Africanized honey bees and its impact on exposure to pathogens such as Nosema ceranae and the deformed wing virus (DWV), the gut microbial community and in honey bee survival. Our results showed that imidacloprid affected the immunity of Africanized honey bees, increasing the expression of lysozyme and decreasing the expression of hymenoptaecin, generating an abnormal physiological state. Imidacloprid together with N. ceranae decreased the expression of vitellogenin. Furthermore, imidacloprid did not affect N. ceranae infection or DWV replication. On the other hand, imidacloprid causes changes in the gut microbiota specially in N. ceranae infected bees. These alterations were reflected in the high mortality rates caused by imidacloprid alone or in combination with N. ceranae. These results corroborate previous findings in European honey bees, which showed the negative effects of imidacloprid.

PRJNA723677,honey bee,Hymenoptera,Seasonal dynamics of the honey bee gut microbiota in colonies under subtropical climate,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) provide invaluable benefits for food production and maintenance of biodiversity of natural environments through pollination. They are widely spread across the world, being adapted to different climatic conditions. To survive the winter in cold temperate regions, honey bees developed different strategies including storage of honey and pollen, confinement of individuals during the winter, and an annual cycle of colony growth and reproduction. Under these conditions, winter honey bees experience physiological changes, including changes in immunity and the composition of honey bee gut microbiota. However, under tropical or subtropical climates, the life cycle can experience alterations, i.e. queens lay eggs during almost all the year and new honey bees emerge constantly. In the present study, we characterized nurses' honey bee gut microbiota in colonies under subtropical region through a year, combining qPCR, PCR-DGGE and 16S rDNA high throughput sequencing. We also identified environmental variables involved in those changes. Our results showed that under the mentioned conditions, the number of bacteria is stable throughout the year. Diversity of gut microbiota is higher in spring and lower in summer and winter. Gradual changes in compositions occur between seasons; Lactobacillus spp. predominate in spring while Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrasella alvi predominate in summer and winter. Environmental variables (mainly precipitations) affected the composition of the honey bee microbiota. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of honey bee gut microbiota and may be useful to understand the adaptation of bees to different environmental conditions.",paired,1,1

However, the gut also constitutes the primary site of exposure to a wide variety of pesticides ingested by honey bees during foraging, and feeding on stored honey and beebread. Recent studies highlighted that exposure to glyphosate can have negative effects on specific members of the core gut microbiota of honey bee workers. However, these studies exposed bees to relatively high glyphosate concentrations and did not assess the possible interactions with other pesticides. Here, we chronically exposed newly emerged honey bees to an environmental concentration of imidacloprid, glyphosate and difenoconazole, individually and in ternary mixture. We studied the effects of these exposures on the establishment of the gut microbiota, the physiological status, the longevity, and food consumption of the host. The core bacterial species were not affected by the exposure to the three pesticides at these environmental concentrations. Negative effects were observed but they were restricted to few transient non-core bacterial species. However, in the absence of the core microbiota, the pesticides induced physiological disruption by directly altering the detoxification system, the antioxidant defenses, and the metabolism of the host. Our study indicates that even mild exposure to pesticides can directly alter the physiological homeostasis of newly emerged honey bees and particularly if the individuals are dysbiotic (i.e. mostly lack the core microbiota). This highlights the importance of an early establishment of a healthy gut bacterial community to strengthen the natural defenses of the honey bee against xenobiotic stressors.",paired,1,1

PRJNA684483,Drosophila,Diptera,Effect of gut microbiota on host use by Anastrepha spp.,"The gut microbiota is key for the homeostasis of some phytophagous insects, but there are still few studies documenting its role on host use by stenophagous or polyphagous fruit flies. Guava (Psidium guajava) is a fruit infested in nature by the tephritids Anastrepha striata and A. fraterculus. In contrast, A. ludens only infests guava under artificial conditions, but unlike A. striata and the Mexican A. fraterculus, it infests oranges (Citrus aurantium) and several other Rutaceae. We used these models to analyze whether gut microbiota could explain the differences in host use observed in these fly species and to test the gut microbial host use facilitation hypothesis (Hammer &amp; Bowers 2015). We compared the gut microbiota of the larvae of the three species when they developed in guava and the microbiota of the fruit pulp larvae fed on. We also compared the gut microbiota of A. ludens developed in C. aurantium with the pulp microbiota. In A. ludens, the composition of the gut microbiota is strongly influenced by environmental microbiota. In contrast, the gut microbiota of A. striata and A. fraterculus were dominated by Wolbachia and was significantly different from the microbiota of the guava pulp. Functional predictions suggest that the gut microbiota of A. striata and A. fraterculus are enriched in detoxification functions. The dominance of Wolbachia in the gut microbiota of A. striata and A. fraterculus represents the first report on the possible role of Wolbachia in facilitating host use in phytophagous insects.",paired,1,1

The dominant species of the gut bacterial community of the larvae did not impact larval performances and metabolism, but rather significantly impacted the host immunity by up-regulating the expression of a gene involved in the response against pathogens. Our study is consistent with the growing literature suggesting that Lepidoptera may not have a gut microbiota beneficial to larval growth or survival, however it showed that other traits which might be important for the fitness of the individuals in nature might have been disregarded while characterizing this host-microbe interaction. To our knowledge, this work is the first one to strongly suggest a link between the gut environment and the immune system of the Glanville fritillary butterfly, a model organism for eco-evolutionary biology.",paired,1,1
PRJNA639597,Moth,Lepidoptera,Gut Microbial Communities in Mealworms and Indianmeal Moth Larvae Respond Differently to Plastic Degradation,"Recent studies describe the role of specific isolated members of insect larval gut microbiota in plastic degradation. However, the effect of plastics on the entire gut microbial community composition and structure is yet unknown. To determine these roles, we studied two insect larvae - Tenebrio molitor degrades polystyrene (PS) and Plodia interpunctella degrades polyethylene (PE). We established two colonies of each species - control (fed oats) and test (fed either PS or PE). After dissecting the larvae to obtain their guts, we extracted, sequenced, and analyzed 16srRNA through amplicon sequencing. In Plodia interpunctella fed only PE, we find significant increased relative abundance of microbial families Pseudomonaceae, Clostridiaceae and Caulobacteraceae - from 0.15% in the control to about 50% in the PE-fed group. In Tenebrio molitor fed only PS, degradation is not associated with significant changes in microbial abundance. We hypothesize that Tenebrio microbiome uses other mechanisms such as protein production and/or cross feeding, retaining the original gut microbial structure and composition during PS degradation. This study showcases the diverse mechanisms used by larval gut microbiota to achieve polyethylene and polystyrene degradation, indicating a variation in the effect of plastic degradation on the gut microbial community of larvae.",single,0,0

Recent studies have unraveled the major role of the gut microbiome of insects as a major modulator of their biological cycle and infectivity. However, we still have limited knowledge about the factors shaping the gut microbiome of sand-flies. We tested the hypothesis that insect species is a major modulator of the gut microbiome of Phlebotomus spp. Sand-flies we collected in traps from the island of Leros, Greece and morphologically classified to P. papatasi, P. tobbi, P. neglectus, P. similis, the former being the most frequently collected species. The prokaryotic gut microbiome was determined via amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. P. papatasi supported a largely different gut bacterial community compared to the other species which clustered closely together. This divergence stemmed from the dominance of two OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Spiroplasma. P. neglectus also showed low bacterial diversity dominated by an OTU belonging to Wolbachia. Conversely, the bacterial microbiome of P. tobbi and P. similis was more diverse characterized by the presence of several less dominant OTUs. The archaeal community was not diverse with the most dominant OTUs belonging to Thaumarcheota, Euryarcheota and Nanoarchaeota. Our study provides pioneering data on the bacterial and archaeal microbiome of Phlebotomus sandflies and demonstrates for the first time the strong filtering effect of genotype on the composition of the gut prokaryotic microbiome. On-going studies will further address the interaction of Leishmania with the gut microbiota of Phlebotomus sandflies.",paired,1,1

Therefore, similar to gut morphology and digestive enzyme activity, gut microbiota may also get altered under plant defensive compound-induced stress. To test the hypothesis, Dendrolimus superans larvae were fed either aconitine- or nicotine-treated fresh leaves of Larix gmelinii, and Lymantria dispar larvae were fed either aconitine- or nicotine-treated fresh leaves of Salix matsudana. Subsequently, larvae were sampled 72 h after diet administration, and DNA extracted from larval enteric canals were employed for gut microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing (338F and 806R primers). Sequence analysis revealed that dietary nicotine and aconitine influenced the dominant bacteria in the larval gut and determined their abundance. Moreover, the effect of either aconitine or nicotine on Dendrolimus superans and Lymantria dispar larvae had greater dependence on insect species than on secondary plant metabolites. These findings indicate the importance of gut microbiota in the interaction between an herbivore and its host plant and in the coevolution of plants and insects.",paired,1,1

However, microbiome sequencing has recently suggested that butterflies are an anomaly, since their microbiomes do not show strong host- and developmental stage-specific associations. We experimentally manipulated butterfly larval gut microbiota and found that disrupting gut microbes had little influence on larval survival and development. Larvae of the butterflies Danaus chrysippus and Ariadne merione that fed on chemically sterilized or antibiotic-treated host plant leaves had significantly reduced bacterial loads, and their gut bacterial communities were disrupted substantially. However, neither host species treated this way suffered a significant fitness cost: across multiple experimental blocks, treated and control larvae had similar survival, growth and development. Furthermore, re-introducing microbes from the excreta of control larvae did not improve larval growth and survival. Thus, these butterfly larvae did not appear to rely on specialized gut bacteria for digestion, detoxification, biomass accumulation, and metamorphosis. Our experiments thus show that dependence on gut bacteria for growth and survival is not a universal phenomenon across insects. Our findings also caution that strategies that target gut microbiomes may not always succeed in controlling Lepidopteran pests.",paired,1,1

However, previous studies integrating nutrition into the network of cancer progression are largely inconsistent. We therefore investigated the effects of dietary restriction, which is the most consistently found beneficial nutritional intervention, on the development of intestinal stem cell tumors in a Drosophila melanogaster model. Submission to dietary restriction led to a decline in tumor mass and a morphological as well as functional rehabilitation of the intestine. Nevertheless, flies submitted to dietary restriction exhibited a drastically reduced lifespan due to substantial loss of body mass. To circumvent these destructive consequences, we applied a nutritional regimen consisting of alternating phases of dietary restriction and a fully nutritious diet. Strikingly, the recurrent diet reduced tumor mass and reinstated gut functionality to the same extend as continuous dietary restriction, while restoring the lifespan of tumor-bearing flies back to the level of healthy controls. Overall design: 16S rRNA and transcriptome sequencing were performed to investigate the effects of dietary restriction on the development of intestinal stem cell tumors in a Drosophila melanogaster model.",paired,1,0

However, there is limited information about the composition of the gut microbial community associated with bumblebee queens is the sole reproductive female in a colony. In the present study, we investigated the diversity of gut bacteria in different physiological state bumblebee queens, (Bombus lantschouensis), including Unmated Queens, Mated Queens, and Oviposition Queens. Our results revealed that there were significant shifts in the composition and copy numbers of microbiome members as queens underwent physiological changeschanged their physiological state.

The Gilliamella (Orbaceae), Snodgrassella (Neisseriaceae), Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus) and Bifidobacterium (Bifidobacteriaceae) were found to be the core bacterial genera in unmated and oviposition queens while the Bacillus (Bacillaceae), Lactococcus (Streptococcaceae) and Pseudomonas (Pseudomonadaceae) were the dominant genera in Mated queens, clearly demonstrating a relationship between the gut bacteria and queen physiological status. We propose testable hypotheses for why mated queens show a distinctive microbiota prior to their winter diapause, before reverting to a microbiota similar to unmated queens once they begin ovispositing. Our study is the first to explore the gut microbiome of bumblebee queens and provides useful information for future to study the gut bacteria function in queen development and colony’s performance. .",paired,0,0

In addition, they are capable of invading and killing agriculturally important plant pest insects which makes them promising candidates for biocontrol applications. Here we assessed the role of type VI secretion system (T6SS) components of type strain CHA0 during interaction with larvae of the cabbage pest Pieris brassicae. We show that the T6SS core apparatus and two VgrG modules, encompassing the respective T6SS spikes (VgrG1a and VgrG1b) and associated effectors (RhsA and Ghh1), contribute significantly to insect pathogenicity of P. protegens in oral infection assays, but not when bacteria are injected directly into the hemolymph. Monitoring of the colonization levels of P. protegens in the gut, hemolymph and excrements of the insect larvae revealed that the invader relies on T6SS and VgrG1a module function to promote hemocoel invasion. A 16S metagenomic analysis demonstrates that T6SS-supported invasion by P. protegens induces significant changes in the insect gut microbiome affecting notably Enterobacteriaceae, a dominant group of the commensal gut bacteria. Our study supports the concept that pathogens deploy T6SS-based strategies to disrupt the commensal microbiota in order to promote host colonization and pathogenesis.",single,0,0

Host diet is a key factor that shapes bacterial communities, but the impact of dietary transitions across insect development is poorly understood. We analyzed bacterial communities of butterfly species across different development stages, using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Butterfly larvae typically consume leaves of a single host plant, whereas adults are more generalist nectar feeders. Thus, we expected bacterial communities to vary substantially across butterfly development. Surprisingly, only few species showed significant dietary and developmental transitions in bacterial communities, suggesting weak impacts of dietary transitions across butterfly development. On the other hand, bacterial communities were strongly influenced by butterfly species and family identity, potentially due to dietary and physiological variation across the host phylogeny. Larvae of most butterfly species largely mirrored bacterial community composition of their diets, suggesting passive acquisition rather than active selection. Overall, our results suggest that although butterflies harbor distinct microbiomes across taxonomic groups and dietary guilds, the dramatic dietary shifts that occur during development do not impose strong selection to maintain distinct bacterial communities across all butterfly hosts.",paired,1,1

However, the relationship between social behavioural traits and the microbial community has received little attention. Honey bees are highly social and the workers perform different behavioural tasks in the colony that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. Here we examined whether the gut microbial community composition of worker honey bees is associated with the behavioural tasks they perform, and therefore also the local environment they are exposed to. We set up five observation hives, in which all workers were matched in age, and observed the behaviour of marked bees in each colony over four days. The gut bacterial communities of bees seen performing predominantly foraging or predominantly in-nest tasks were then characterised and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results show that core members of the unique honey bee gut bacterial community are represented in different relative abundances in bees performing different behavioural tasks. The differentially represented bacterial taxa include some thought to be important in carbohydrate metabolism and transport, and also linked to bee health. The results provide evidence for an influence of task related local environment exposure on the honey bee gut microbial community and identify focal core taxa for further functional analyses.",paired,1,1

However the complex interactions between gut microbes and environment are still unclear. Honey bees are ecologically and economically important pollinators that host a core gut microbial community that is thought to be constant across populations. Here we examined whether the composition of the gut microbial community of honey bees is affected by the environmental landscape the bees are exposed to. We placed honey bee colonies reared under identical conditions in two main landscape types for six weeks: either oilseed rape farmland or agricultural farmland distant to fields of flowering oilseed rape.  The gut bacterial communities of adult bees from the colonies were then characterised and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. While previous studies have delineated a characteristic core set of bacteria inhabiting the honey bee gut, our results suggest that the broad environment that bees are exposed to has some influence on the relative abundance of some members of that microbial community. This includes known dominant taxa thought to have functions in nutrition and health. Our results provide evidence for an influence of landscape exposure on honey bee microbial community and highlight the potential effect of exposure to different environmental parameters, such as forage type and neonicotinoid pesticides, on key honey bee gut bacteria. This work emphasises the complexity of the relationship between the host, its gut bacteria, and the environment and identifies target microbial taxa for functional analyses.",paired,1,1

PRJNA415376,Drosophila,Diptera,Microbiomes and RI in Drosophila,"Experimental studies of the evolution of reproductive isolation (RI) in real time are a powerful way in which to reveal fundamental, early processes that initiate divergence. In a classic ‘speciation experiment’, populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura were subjected to divergent dietary selection and evolved significant positive assortative mating by diet. More recently, a direct role for the gut microbiome in determining this type of RI in D. melanogaster has been proposed. Manipulation of the diet, and hence gut microbiome, was reported to result in immediate assortative mating by diet, which could be eliminated by reducing gut microbes using antibiotics and recreated by ‘adding back’ Lactobacillus plantarum. We suggest that the evolutionary significance of this result is unclear. For example, in D. melanogaster, the microbiome is reported as flexible and largely environmentally-determined. Therefore, microbiome-mediated RI would be transient and would break down under dietary variation. In the absence of evolutionary co-association or recurrent exposure between host and microbiome, there are also no advantages for the gut bacteria or host in effecting RI. To explore these puzzling effects and their mechanisms further, we repeated the tests for RI associated with diet-specific gut microbiomes in D. melanogaster. Despite observing differences in the gut microbiomes in flies maintained on different diets, we found no evidence for diet-associated RI, for any role of gut bacteria, or for L. plantarum specifically. The results suggest that there is no general role for gut bacteria in driving the evolution of RI in this species and thus resolve an evolutionary riddle.",paired,1,1

PRJNA412848,,,Adapterama II: Universal amplicon sequencing on Illumina platforms (TaggiMatrix),"Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms allow massive quantities of DNA sequences to be obtained at low cost per read, sequencing PCR amplicons remains relatively expensive. NGS amplicon sequencing strategies have relied upon fusion of locus-specific primers to full-length adapter sequences with a single identifying sequence (i.e., an index or tag) or ligating adapters onto pools of PCR products. Herein we describe an approach that uses locus-specific PCR primers to produce many indexed Illumina libraries ( 9216 samples). We fuse partial adapter sequences of variable length (Nextera or TruSeq) onto the 5’ end of locus-specific PCR primers (fusion primers) with the option of adding tag sequences between the adapter and locus-specific sequences. We then use forward and reverse fusion primers combinatorically and then pooled for a subsequent PCR with dual-indexed iNext or iTru primers (also used combinatorically) to make full-length libraries. The resulting quadruple-indexed amplicons have diversity at most base positions so they can be pooled with any standard Illumina library for sequencing. Importantly, the number of sequence reads from the amplicon pools can be easily tuned, reducing the sequencing cost per sample to where it is economically trivial. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with results from five projects, each with a different implementation of our protocol. We show that by using fusion primers together with hundreds of available iTru or iNext primers, millions of potential combinations exist, thereby facilitating Illumina library construction of amplicons via simple PCR protocols and encouraging cooperation among researchers using NGS.",paired,1,1

There are a variety of herbivore counteradaptations to plant defenses, and growing body of research describes the role of symbiotic gut bacteria in mediating herbivorous diets among insects. However, persistent bacterial symbioses have not been described in detail for Lepidoptera, despite being one of the largest herbivore groups on earth. We surveyed larvae from 31 species of lycaenid butterflies and compared the gut bacterial communities associated with species with diverse diets. Contrary to our expectations, we find that the bacterial communities of carnivorous and herbivorous caterpillars do not differ in richness, diversity, or composition. Many of the observed bacterial genera are commonly found in soil and plant surfaces, and we detected known homopteran endosymbionts in the guts of homopterophagous species, suggesting that larvae acquire many of the gut bacteria from their food and environment. These results indicate that lycaenid butterflies do not rely on bacterial symbioses to mediate their diverse diets, and provide further evidence of depauperate bacterial communities among Lepidoptera.",single,0,0

Early gut succession and diet-related shifts in bacterial community composition can be associated with a variety of acute and chronic diseases. Here we determined the effect of host niche and nutrient source on gut bacterial composition of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). We provided caged bees with naturally collected pollen and pollen substitute, both fresh and aged, then recorded host development and bacterial community composition of four nutrient-processing host niches. Feeding fresh pollen or fresh substitute, we found no difference in host mortality, consumption rate, development, or microbial community composition. In contrast, bees fed aged nutrition differed markedly, suffering impaired development, increased mortality, and developed a significantly different microbiome throughout the alimentary tract. Consuming an aged nutrient source resulted in a significant reduction of the core ileum bacterium Snodgrassella alvi and a corresponding increase of opportunistic pathogen Frischella perrara. Moreover, the relative abundance of S. alvi in the ileum was positively correlated with host survival and development. The inverse was true for F. perrara, reinforcing its role as an opportunistic gut pathogen. Echoing results from bumble bees, Parasacharibacter apium was also associated with negative host effects in general. Collectively, our findings suggest that the early establishment of S. alvi is associated with healthy nurse development, potentially excluding F. perrara and P. apium from the ileum. The pattern of dysbiosis in the ileum was reflected in the rectum, mouthparts and hypopharyngeal glands, suggesting a systemic physiological response. Our findings provide insight into the role nutrition plays in host health and the establishment of a characeristic gut microbiome.",single,0,0

It is increasingly evident from many literatures that the gut microbiota plays a remarkable role in the insects’ life. The gut microbiome affects all aspects of the holobiont’s (insect plus all of its associated microorganisms) fitness such as adaptation, survival, development, growth, reproduction and evolution. To classify bacteria, the 16S rRNA is commonly used because of its ubiquitous presence among prokaryotic organisms. Due to its small size of approximately 1,500 bp and its alternating structure of highly conserved and hypervariable regions (V1-V9) the 16S rRNA gene is well suited for identification and phylogenic analysis of organisms.

PRJEB6788,Mosquito,Diptera,Developmental succession of the microbiome of Culex mosquitoes,"Background The native microflora associated with mosquitoes have important roles in mosquito development and vector competence. Sequencing of bacterial V3 region from 16S rRNA genes across the developmental stages of Culex mosquitoes (early and late larval instars, pupae and adults) was used to test the hypothesis that bacteria found in the larval stage of Culex are transstadially transmitted to the adult stage, and to compare the microbiomes of field-collected versus laboratory-reared mosquitoes. Results Beta diversity analysis revealed that bacterial community structure differed among three life stages (larvae, pupae and adults) of Culex tarsalis. Although only ~2 % of the total number of bacterial OTUs were found in all stages, sequences from these OTUs accounted for nearly 82 % of the total bacterial sequences recovered from all stages. Thorsellia (Gammaproteobacteria) was the most abundant bacterial taxon found across all developmental stages of field-collected Culex mosquitoes, but was rare in mosquitoes from laboratory-reared colonies. The proportion of Thorsellia sequences in the microbiomes of mosquito life stages varied ontogenetically with the greatest proportions recovered from the pupae of C. tarsalis and the lowest from newly emerged adults. The microbiome of field-collected late instar larvae was not influenced significantly by differences in the microbiota of the habitat due to habitat age or biopesticide treatments. The microbiome diversity was the greatest in the early instar larvae and the lowest in laboratory-reared mosquitoes. Conclusions Bacterial communities in early instar C. tarsalis larvae were significantly more diverse when compared to late instar larvae, pupae and newly emerged adults. Some of the bacterial OTUs found in the early instar larvae were also found across developmental stages. Thorsellia dominated the bacterial communities in field-collected immature stages but occurred at much lower relative abundance in adults. Differences in microbiota observed in larval habitats did not influence bacterial community profiles of late instar larvae or adults. However, bacterial communities in laboratory-reared C. tarsalis larvae differed significantly from the field. Determining the role of Thorsellia in mosquitoes and its distribution across different species of mosquitoes warrants further investigation.",paired,1,1
PRJEB3414,Blattella germanica,Blattodea,Ontogeny of the gut microbiota in the cockroach Blattella germanica,"Bacterial symbionts of insects have many metabolic activities that are absent in their hosts, and vice versa. Blattabacterium lives inside the fat body cells of most of the cockroaches and plays an important role in nitrogen recycling. These insects also carry a variety of exosymbionts attached to the gastrointestinal walls, which collaborate in digestion and act as a barrier against colonization by pathogens, among other functions. For this work, the cockroach Blattella germanica was chosen in part by its importance as an indoor pest and also, because of its experimental convenience due to its short life cycle. The mode of acquisition of the gut exosymbionts is unknown, as well as the dynamics of their ecological succession across the life cycle of the insect. We have characterized the intestinal flora by different approaches. First, electron scanning microscopy confirmed the presence of a bacterial biofilm exclusively in the hindgut. qPCR revealed that the bacterial load in the gut increases with age. Pyrosequencing the hyper-variable regions V1-V3 of the 16S rRNA genes present in the guts of all the nymphal instars and adults of B. germanica revealed that the microbial composition is stage-specific through the development of the insect. Last, analysis of the embryos demonstrated that Blattabacterium is the only symbiont inherited maternally via the eggs, running out to elucidate the mode of adquisition of the intestinal microbiota.",single,0,0

PRJNA226433,Cephalotes varians,Hymenoptera,Gut microbiota of Cephalotes varians Metagenome,"Insect guts are often colonized by multi-species microbial communities that play integral roles in nutrition, digestion, and defense. Community composition can differ across host species with increasing dietary and genetic divergence, yet gut microbiota can also vary between conspecific hosts and across an individual’s lifespan. Through exploration of such intraspecific variation and its correlates, molecular profiling of microbial communities can generate and test hypotheses on the causes and consequences of symbioses. In this study, we used 454 pyrosequencing and TRFLP analyses to achieve these goals in an herbivorous ant, Cephalotes varians, exploring variation in bacterial communities across colonies, populations, and workers reared on different diets. We found that C. varians bacterial communities were dominated by 16 core species present in over two-thirds of the sampled colonies. Core bacteria hailed from ant-specific clades, with most having close relatives in other Cephalotes species. Yet three were detected in environmental samples, suggesting possible environmental acquisition. In spite of their prevalence and long-standing relationships with Cephalotes ants, the relative abundance and genotypic composition of core species varied across colonies. Diet-induced plasticity is a likely cause, but only pollen-based diets had consistent effects, altering the abundance of just a few bacteria. Additional factors such as host age, genetics, chance, or natural selection must therefore shape natural variation. Future studies on these possibilities and on bacterial contributions to the use of pollen, a widespread food source across Cephalotes, will be important steps in developing C. varians as a model for studying widespread social insect-bacteria symbioses.",single,0,0

These insects are ecologically important and represent useful natural analogs for biomass to biofuel conversion. Using a range of molecular approaches combined with microelectrode measurements of oxygen, we have characterized the gut microbiome and physiology of Odontotaenius disjunctus, a wood-feeding beetle native to the eastern United States. We hypothesized that morphological and physiological differences among gut regions would correspond to distinct microbial populations and activities. In fact, significantly different communities were found in the foregut (FG), midgut (MG)/posterior hindgut (PHG), and anterior hindgut (AHG), with Actinobacteria and Rhizobiales being more abundant towards the FG and PHG. Conversely, fermentative bacteria such as Bacteroidetes and Clostridia were more abundant in the AHG, also the sole region where methanogenic Archaea were detected. Although each gut region possessed an anaerobic core, micron-scale profiling identified radial gradients in oxygen concentration in all regions. Nitrogen fixation was confirmed by 15N2 incorporation, and nitrogenase gene (nifH) expression was greatest in the AHG. Phylogenetic analysis of nifH identified the most abundant transcript as related to Ni-Fe nitrogenase of a Bacteroidetes species, Paludibacter propionicigenes. Overall we demonstrate not only a compartmentalized microbiome in this beetle digestive tract, but also sharp oxygen gradients that may permit aerobic and anaerobic metabolism to occur within the same regions in close proximity.

To test the hypothesis that some microbes inhibit the growth of other microbes, we applied four treatments to the pollen provisions of M. rotundata eggs and young larvae: antibacterials, antifungals, A. aggregata spores, and a no-treatment control. We allowed the larvae to develop and used 454 pyrosequencing to quantify fungal and bacterial communities in the larval gut. Antifungals lowered the abundance of A. aggregata and correspondingly increased the relative diversity of surviving fungi. Antibacterials altered the bacterial community, but not the fungal community. Interactions between A. aggregata and other fungi, but not between bacteria and fungi, appear to be important for fungal community structure in the larval gut. Lactobacillus kunkeei clade bacteria were common members of the larval gut microbiota, and exhibited antibiotic resistance. Because L. kunkeei is also found in honey bees and is likely transferred between bee lineages at flowers, the observed antibiotic resistance may have originated from exposure to pesticides applied to honey bee colonies. This suggests that pesticide application to honey bees can have far-reaching effects on the microbiota of native bee populations. <p> Guts from Megachile rotundata larvae that had been treated with either: 1) antibacterials 2) antifungals 3) Chalkbrood (a fungal pathogen) spores 4) No-treatment control.",single,0,0

Most notably, the biggest challenge faced by this insect as it feeds in the heartwood is the lignin biopolymer, which surrounds and encases trace nutrients and structural carbohydrates that could be assimilated and utilized by the beetle.

We combined experimental manipulation with community-level analyses to elucidate the function of the gut symbionts in both pyrrhocorid species. Elimination of symbionts by egg-surface sterilization resulted in significantly higher mortality and reduced growth rates, demonstrating that the microbial community plays an important role for host nutrition. Fitness of symbiont-deprived bugs could be completely restored by re-infection with the original microbiota, while reciprocal cross-infections of microbial communities across both pyrrhocorid species only partially rescued fitness, indicating a high degree of host-symbiont specificity. Exhaustive community-level analyses by quantitative PCRs targeting the dominant bacterial strains allowed us to link the observed fitness effects exclusively to the abundance of the two actinobacterial symbionts. Thus, the nutritional mutualism with Actinobacteria may have represented a key evolutionary innovation that contributed significantly to the ecological success of the economically important group of pyrrhocorid bugs. <p> Midgut microbial community of Dysdercus fasciatus sequenced using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing.",single,0,0

Although many insects are inhabited by complex microbial communities, most studies on insect mutualists so far have focused on single endosymbionts and their interactions with the host. Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of the gut microbiota of the red firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus, Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae), a model organism for physiological and endocrinological research. A combination of several culture-independent techniques (454-pyrosequencing, quantitative PCR and cloning/sequencing) revealed a diverse community of likely transient bacterial taxa in the mid-gut regions M1, M2 and M4. However, the completely anoxic M3 region harbored a distinct microbiota consisting of facultative and obligate anaerobes including Actinobacteria (Coriobacterium glomerans and Gordonibacter sp.), Firmicutes (Clostridium sp. and Lactococcus lactis), and Proteobacteria (Klebsiella sp., and a previously undescribed Rickettsiales bacterium). Characterization of the M3 microbiota in different life stages of P. apterus indicated that the symbiotic bacterial community is transmitted vertically and becomes well defined between the second and third nymphal instar, which coincides with the initiation of feeding. Comparing the midgut M3 microbial communities of P. apterus individuals from five different populations and after feeding on three different diets revealed that the community composition is qualitatively and quantitatively very stable, with the six predominant taxa being consistently abundant.
